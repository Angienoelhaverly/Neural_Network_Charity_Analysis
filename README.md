# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
Explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python
### Project Purpose
Neural networks are powerful machine learning techniques that are modeled after neurons in the brain that are effective with complex datasets. Deep Neural networks are used for analyzing images and natural language processing datasets. An advantage of neural network machine learning is that it doesn't have to worry about any statistical theory. This form of machine learning is effective because it contains multiple layers of neurons that perform computations which are then connected and weighed against one another until a final layer is formed. They recognize patterns and features in input data and can be used for both classification and regression purposes. They are also effective at detecting complex nonlinear relationships.
